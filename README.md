# Wedding website
Hello, this is Vivian. I am NOT a programmer. However, i had picked up some
programming skills over the years, mostly Python, R and Matlab. This is my first
website[1], so please be gentle.

# Documentation (to be updated...)

# Website forked from

_See [wedding.rampatra.com](http://wedding.rampatra.com/) for a demo._

[1]: If you don't count the computer classes in high school where we learned to
make a local static HTML page that says "Hello, world!". I vaguely remember
making text flash with `<blink> </blink>`. I thought that was cool.
