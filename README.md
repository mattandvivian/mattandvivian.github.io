Hello, this is Vivian. I am NOT a programmer. However, i had picked up some
programming skills over the years, mostly Python, R and Matlab. This is my first
website<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup>, so please be gentle.

<a name="footnote1">1</a>: If you don't count the computer classes in high
school where we learned to make a local static HTML page that says "Hello,
world!". I vaguely remember making text flash with `<blink> </blink>`. I thought
that was cool.
